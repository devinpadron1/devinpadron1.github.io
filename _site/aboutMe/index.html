                <p>Hello!</p>
                <p>My name is Devin Padrón. I was born in New Jersey, raised in Puerto Rico, and currently working as a mechanical design engineer in Florida. In my role, I use various software tools to design mechanical components and systems for spacecraft and other applications.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I greatly enjoy learning about computer science and related topics. I have been teaching myself programming in my free time, focusing mainly on languages including Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have worked on projects such as building this website, automation scripts, and web-based games.</p>
